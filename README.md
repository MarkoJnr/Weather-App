#Weather-CLI-App
### My first project created in Python via the Command Line (CLI). One of the strengths of Python is that it has a rich and versatile standard library that makes it one of the best programming languages for writing scripts on the command line. I used the Python argparse library as it provides the best command line interface and was extremely user-friendly when configuring the program.
